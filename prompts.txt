You're almost there
Just about
Just a little further
You can see the light
Not far now
Any minute now
You seem confused
You've accomplished so little
Now what?
Ready when you are
Here it comes
Eventually
You'll make it
I'm sure you'll live
PLACEHOLDER
Oops
Quickly now
Please, tell me more
You have such nice eyes
One day...
Tick-tock
Clock's ticking
Go red team, go!
Piss-for-brains
How much longer?
Are we there yet?
You must be frightened
Don't you dare
Who do you think you are?
Get help
Sooner rather than later
Your move
You're up
Godspeed
Is it that late already?
Try harder
The end is in sight
It's within reach
It's better not to ask
It's that time again
Here we go again
Please hurry
This better be worth it
Again
This is it
Now's you're chance
Good luck
Have fun
Keep quiet
Did you hear that?
What is that smell?
There's something in your teeth
It's up to you
The time has come
Click-clack
Wow!
You're gonna be okay
Don't forget to breathe
Forgetting something?
Stop and smell the flowers
This isn't so bad
Do what you will
I can't stop you
Just one after another
Don't doubt yourself
Keep your chin up
Straighten your back
Take a break
Relax
Slow down
Take it easy
Be careful
Having second thoughts?
You must be exhausted
You have nice eyes
